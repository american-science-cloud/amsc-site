## About USWDS Integration

This site uses the **U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)** â€” https://designsystem.digital.gov/ â€” for its design foundation and component styling.  
USWDS provides standardized, accessible front-end patterns used across U.S. government websites.

Key benefits:
- Consistent, accessible design language compliant with federal standards  
- Built-in typography, grid, spacing, and color utilities  
- Responsive, mobile-first design system that integrates cleanly with Docusaurus themes

The theme and component styles have been customized to align with the American Science Cloudâ€™s branding while maintaining USWDS accessibility and usability standards.

## Local Setup (First-Time Install)

If you're setting up this project for the first time:

1. Clone the repository  
â€ƒgit clone https://github.com/american-science-cloud/amsc-site.git  
â€ƒcd amsc-site  

2. Install dependencies  
â€ƒnpm install  

3. Run the development server  
â€ƒnpm run start  

4. Visit your site locally at:  
â€ƒhttp://localhost:3000  

---

## Local Development

Run the development server:  
â€ƒnpm run start  

Your site will be available at http://localhost:3000  

Edits to Markdown and React files in `/docs` or `/src` reload automatically.

## Test the Production Build Locally

Before deploying, verify the production build using the same settings as GitHub Pages.

1. Build your site:  npm run build  
2. Serve the build locally:  npm run serve  
3. Open your browser to:  http://localhost:3000/amsc-site/  

This tests your site exactly as it will appear on GitHub Pages, including the correct `baseUrl` (`/amsc-site/`).

---

## Configuration Highlights

- **Base URL:**  baseUrl: '/amsc-site/'   
â€ƒEnsures all assets and routes work correctly on GitHub Pages.  

- **Organization / Project Names:**    
â€ƒorganizationName: 'american-science-cloud'  
â€ƒprojectName: 'amsc-site'  

- **Deployment branch:**  gh-pages  

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Automatic Deployment via GitHub Actions

When you push changes to the **main** branch:

1. GitHub Actions runs the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`  
2. It installs dependencies, builds the site, and deploys it to the **gh-pages** branch.  
3. GitHub Pages serves the latest build automatically at https://american-science-cloud.github.io/amsc-site/  

No manual steps required  

---

### Manual Deployment (optional)

You can also deploy manually if needed:  
â€ƒnpm run deploy  

This runs the Docusaurus deployment command locally, building the site and pushing the `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
